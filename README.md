##  Data Cleaning Summary

The original dataset had some inconsistencies and missing values. The following steps were taken to clean the data:

- **Duplicates Removed**: Ensured unique records
- **Missing Values Handled**:
  - `country`: Filled with `'Unknown'`
  - `cast` and `director`: Filled with `'Not Available'`
- **Date Format Fixed**: The `date_added` column had leading spaces; they were stripped and then parsed using `pd.to_datetime()` with `errors='coerce'`.
